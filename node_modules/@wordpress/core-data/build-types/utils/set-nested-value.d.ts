/**
 * Sets the value at path of object.
 * If a portion of path doesn’t exist, it’s created.
 * Arrays are created for missing index properties while objects are created
 * for all other missing properties.
 *
 * Path is specified as either:
 * - a string of properties, separated by dots, for example: "x.y".
 * - an array of properties, for example `[ 'x', 'y' ]`.
 *
 * This function intentionally mutates the input object.
 *
 * Inspired by _.set().
 *
 * @see https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#set
 *
 * @todo Needs to be deduplicated with its copy in `@wordpress/edit-site`.
 *
 * @param {Object}       object Object to modify
 * @param {Array|string} path   Path of the property to set.
 * @param {*}            value  Value to set.
